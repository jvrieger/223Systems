Reflection
I thought this lab went well, the only issue I encourntered was messing 
up the algorithm for insertion sort by forgetting to set pos to i-1.
It was an easy fix and I got the program running quickly. Having the sorted()
function from the start made debugging much easier because I could see the 
internals of the array and know if the sort was working.
