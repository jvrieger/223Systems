Assignment 2 CS223 Reflection

This assignment mostly went smoothly, I had the biggest issue with the sort instructions
for the assignment for shout.c however. The assignment says to use the sort command, but
after looking into the book for a sort command, all I could find was information on how
to implement your own sorts, so I made a selection sort. For the mywc.c program I struggled
with defining what a word was--was it just something divided by whitespace? What about words
that end with punctuation or words that are seperated by dashes but not whitespace? Overall
I was a little confused with the assignment instructions but the coding itself went smoothly.
